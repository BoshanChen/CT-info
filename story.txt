"You will get a billion dollars, but there will always be a super snail chasing you and trying to kill you. Reply anything to accpet, ignore this message if you are not interested." 

I try to turn off the alarm, but this message appears on my phone. "A billion dollar? Super snail? Am I still dreaming?" I put down my phone and go back to sleep. But I realize this is real when I finally wake up. "Oh, come on! Someone must be kidding me." Then, I reply the email: "Who are you?" Immediately, I receive a new message, "Congradulations! Now the dollars are yours!" One second later, my chase bank app reminds me that I received a billion dollars.

"Are you kidding me?" I can't believe the money in my account, which I may not even have a chance to see in my life. But now, it is real, it is in my account. I pay too much attention to the number so that I don't see there is a black spot on my phone. When I focus to the black spot, I just find that it is a snail.

"Are you the 'super snail'?" Let's check how super you are. I throw my phone to the floor, trying to kill it. However, when I pick up my phone, there's nothing but a broken screen. "Is it dead?" I can't help thinking it when going downstairs to prepare my breakfast.

"It is a billion! I must plan well how to use the money!" The snail's death disappears quickly in my mind. At this time, I don't notice there is a black spot approaching me. And it is too late when I finally notice it, the snail is already on my right hand. I try to move my right hand, but it seems not belong to me.

"What???" I use my left hand get the snail down with a fork. "S**t, I need to go to the hospital." I get my car keys and go to my garage. "Oh, I cannot drive now. I should call an uber."

The uber drive finally come. I get into the car, sitting in the back. "Young man, today is your lucky day! A billion is a lot." "What? How do you know? You sent the message?"...
