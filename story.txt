"You will get a billion dollars, but there will always be a super snail chasing you and trying to kill you. Reply anything to accpet, ignore this message if you are not interested." 

I try to turn off the alarm, but this message appears on my phone. "A billion dollar? Super snail? Am I still dreaming?" I put down my phone and go back to sleep. But I realize this is real when I finally wake up. "Oh, come on! Someone must be kidding me." Then, I reply the email: "Who are you?" Immediately, I receive a new message, "Congradulations! Now the dollars are yours!" One second later, my chase bank app reminds me that I received a billion dollars.

"Are you kidding me?" I can't believe the money in my account, which I may not even have a chance to see in my life. But now, it is real, it is in my account. I pay too much attention to the number so that I don't see there is a black spot on my phone. When I focus to the black spot, I just find that it is a snail.

"Are you the 'super snail'?" Let's check how super you are. I throw my phone to the floor, trying to kill it. However, when I pick up my phone, there's nothing but a broken screen. "Is it dead?" I can't help thinking it when going downstairs to prepare my breakfast.

"It is a billion! I must plan well how to use the money!" The snail's death disappears quickly in my mind. At this time, I don't notice there is a black spot approaching me. And it is too late when I finally notice it, the snail is already on my right hand. I try to move my right hand, but it seems not belong to me.

"What???" I use my left hand get the snail down with a fork. "S**t, I need to go to the hospital." I get my car keys and go to my garage. "Oh, I cannot drive now. I should call an uber."

The uber drive finally come. I get into the car, sitting in the back. "Young man, today is your lucky day! A billion is a lot." "What? How do you know? You sent the message?"...

"You are not the only one who received the message." Replied the driver, "I guess you've already seen a snail then." He continues as he drives, "you don't need to know who I am and why I know all these things. Now here are the rules of this game."

"The super snail that is chasing you has a normal moving speed just like other snails do. However, it is called 'super' because it is immortal and can get to any spaces in this world, even a closed room or the sea floor. You cannot kill it or contain it. All it does is chasing you in a shortest way on the ground no matter where you are. Once you accepted that one billion dollars, it will appear at a random spot that is within 10km from where you are. The refreshing time for this relocation is 00:00 AM GMT time."

He says these rules with seeming passion. "You have no resorts to mark this snail, and it looks just like a normal snail. In other word," the driver smiles, "it could be any snails in this world." He does not wait for my responce and continues, "now here comes the interesting part of this game. Once that super snail has any physical contacts with you, you will die immediately." "But I am still alive right now." "You are lucky, my boy. Clearly that is not the super snail." The driver stops his car by a Chase bank branch, "now go check your money, and good luck." I stand in front of the bank as he lefts me off and drives away, trying to figure out what the hell is happening right now.
